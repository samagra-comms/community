# 1. Add enviorment variable in IDE

## 1.1 Kafka
Kafka is used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and real-time streaming applications. A data pipeline reliably processes and moves data from one system to another, and a streaming application is an application that consumes streams of data.

we use XMessage to converse between our services, It is sent to Kafka topics. Then
different services consume these XMessages from Kafka and process further.  

* Setup Kafka with [quickstart](https://kafka.apache.org/quickstart) guide.
* Generate the following Kafka topics and add following values :
```
BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS = # Kafka bootstrap server host/IP
REGISTRY_URL = # Schema Registry URL generated from kafka

# kafka topics for sending and receiving XMessage from our services

KAFKA_CAMPAIGN_TOPIC=campaign
KAFKA_INBOUND_ERROR_TOPIC=inbound-error
KAFKA_INBOUND_GS_OPTED_OUT_TOPIC=gs-opted-out
KAFKA_INBOUND_PROCESSED_TOPIC=inbound-processed
KAFKA_INBOUND_UNPROCESSED_TOPIC=inbound-unprocessed
KAFKA_LOGS_TOPIC=uci-telemetry-logs
KAFKA_ODK_TRANSFORMER_TOPIC=com.odk.transformer
KAFKA_ODK_TRANSFORMER_TOPIC_PATTERN=com.odk.*
KAFKA_OUTBOUND_TOPIC=outbound
KAFKA_TELEMETRY_TOPIC=telemetry

```

## 1.2 Redis :
We are using Redis for caching the latest XMessage sent/received by user. We would be further using this for caching other elements.

* Host Redis Using Redis [Quickstart](https://redis.io/topics/quickstart) and add below values :
```
REDIS_DB_INDEX = # Database Index
REDIS_HOST = # Redis Host
REDIS_PORT = # Redis port
```

## 1.3 ODK (Open Data Kit):
ODK is being used to define the flow/logic of a bot. use this link [ODK](https://docs.getodk.org/aggregate-digital-ocean/) to set up and generate its credentials.
```
ODK_PASS = # ODK Passowrd
ODK_URL = # ODK URL
ODK_USER = # ODK Username
```

## 1.4 FusionAuth :
Fusion Auth is being used to store and Authenticate user data it also stores the user consent to fetch its data (in decrypted form). Deploy Fusion Auth with installation [Guide](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker).

* Generate Fusion Auth Key and Url using [Documentation](https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/apis/keys#generate-a-key).

```
FUSIONAUTH_KEY = # Generated Fusion Key
FUSIONAUTH_URL = # Generated Fusion URL
```

## 1.5 Assessment answer comparison characters :
We are using assessment characters to go to the previous state or restart the conversation. 

```
# To restart the bot
ASSESSMENT_GO_TO_START_CHAR=*

# To go back to the previous state
ASSESSMENT_ONE_LEVEL_UP_CHAR=#
```

## 1.6 Caffeine :
Caffeine is a high-performance Java 8 based caching library providing a near-optimal hit rate. It provides an in-memory cache very similar to the Google Guava API.     

Caffeine is being used to cache all the API calls to [federation service](https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-apis/). 

```
CAFFEINE_CACHE_EXPIRE_DURATION=300
CAFFEINE_CACHE_MAX_SIZE=0

```

## 1.7 Postgresql :
PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational database system. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational) querying.

It is being used to store the question and assessment data and respective to ODK form questions.  

* Setup postgreSQL using [guide](https://zhao-li.medium.com/getting-started-with-postgresql-using-docker-compose-34d6b808c47c).
* Create a new Database and add the following values :
```
FORMS_DB_HOST = # Database Host
FORMS_DB_NAME = # Database Name
FORMS_DB_USERNAME = # Database Username
FORMS_DB_PASSWORD = # Database Password
FORMS_DB_PORT = # Port
FORMS_DB_URL = # Database URL
```


## 1.8 Netcore  :
Netcore is a service provider which is being used to sent/receive messages from the user for various channels (Whats App, Telegram, etc.)

Please contact the Netcore administrator to  get these details
```
NETCORE_WHATSAPP_AUTH_TOKEN = # Authentication Token 

NETCORE_WHATSAPP_SOURCE = # Source ID for sending messages to Netcore 

NETCORE_WHATSAPP_URI = # Netcore API Base URL
```

## 1.9 Cassandra :

Cassandra is one of the most efficient and widely-used NoSQL databases. One of the key benefits of this system is that it offers highly-available service and no single point of failure.

Cassandra is being used to store XMessages.

deploy Apache [Cassandra](https://hub.docker.com/r/bitnami/cassandra/) and add below values
```
CASSANDRA_KEYSPACE = # Keyspace name
CASSANDRA_PORT = # Cassandra Port
CASSANDRA_URL = # Cassandra URL
```

## 1.10 Campaign URL and token :
To connect to [federation service](https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-apis/) API use the below details:

Generate campaign admin token using [uci-apis](https://github.com/samagra-comms/uci-apis) project.

```
CAMPAIGN_ADMIN_TOKEN = # Authentication token
CAMPAIGN_URL = # federation service base URl
```

## 1.12 Transport Socket Base URL :
Outbound base URL for Diksha service provider. We can generate Transport Socket Base URL with [transport-socket](https://github.com/samagra-comms/transport-socket/tree/uci-pwa) Project
```
# Sunbird Adapater Outbound URL
TRANSPORT_SOCKET_BASE_URL = # Transport Socket Base URL
```

## 1.13 Telemetry
we are sending events to telemetry for exhaust generation, the telemetry specs being used is [here](https://github.com/sunbird-specs/Telemetry/blob/master/learn/specification.md).  
the PData is a unique id assigned to this component

```
TELEMETRY_EVENT_PDATA_ID = # Telemetry Exhaust PDATA
```

## 1.14 Other enviorment variables :
```
# In which enviorment we are working
ENV = dev 
WEBCLIENT_HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 5
```
